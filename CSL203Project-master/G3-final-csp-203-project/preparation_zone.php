						<h3>Coding Round</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>For most of the top companies visiting our campus <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">geeksforgeeks</a> is more than enough for practice.</li>
							<li>If you are aiming too high(off-campus) like codenation, google, tower research, etc… geeksforgeeks is not enough. Visit <a href="https://leetcode.com/">leetcode</a> and/or <a href="https://www.interviewbit.com/">interviewbit</a>.</li>

							<li>Generally coding round consists of only data structures and algorithm coding problems.</li>
							<li>Many companies do ask multiple choice questions from aptitude and core computer science.</li>
							<li>At most 50% weightage is given to multiple choice questions, at least 50% weightage is given to coding questions.</li>

							<li>Coding questions generally are function based problems, you just need to complete the function.</li>
							<li>Coding questions generally lies around arrays, linked list and binary tree.</li>
							<li>During coding round copy is blocked which means ctrl + c, ctrl + x, ctrl + v won’t work on their platforms.</li>
							<li>Carefully look over selected language before you start writing code as copying is blocked.</li>
							<li>Don’t try to open new tab or terminal or anything else, browser will detect that and that incident will be reported, it can backfire to you.</li>


							<li>Sometimes test cases are weak, brute force solution may pass. If you are unable to device efficient solution then there is no harm in trying brute force solution. Amaz*n is well known to give poor test cases :p</li>

							<li>Aptitude question generally lies closer to basic maths and some probability. GS and go-jek are well known for this.</li>
